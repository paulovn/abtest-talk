In this case, you’d want to track the effect that the experiment has on the sales of each product. (iii) You may wish to count conversions at several stages down the conversion funnel. That way, if you’re aiming to increase, say, the number of orders, but your test doesn’t reach statistical significance, you may instead choose to consider an intermediate goal such as click-throughs (such as add-to-cart actions), and make the assumption that the number of orders would be proportional to the number of click-throughs.">

Though this feature may have great benefits for you, be aware that a vendor benefits greatly from being able to “lock you in” in this manner, so they may be tempted to over-enthusiastically sell the benefits of this feature.">
